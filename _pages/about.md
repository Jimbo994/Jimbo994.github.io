I am a Phd student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) (AMLab) in the [AI4Science](https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io/) initiative. I collaborate with the [Chemometrics and Advanced Separations Team](https://cast-amsterdam.org/) (CAST) and the [Computational Chemistry group](https://compchem.nl/) at the [Van 't Hoff institute for Molecular Sciences](https://hims.uva.nl/) (HIMS).  

Under supervision of [Bernd Ensing](https://www.compchem.nl/staff_members/dr-ir-b-bernd-ensing/), [Bob Pirok](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/p/i/b.w.j.pirok/b.w.j.pirok.html) and [Patrick Forr√©](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/people/PatrickForre/), I am currently working on [closed-loop automated method development in liquid chromatography](https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io/research/), applying both phyiscal models and machine learning. My main research interests are Bayesian optimization, deep learning, molecular modeling, multi-objective optimization and general application of machine learning to problems in chemistry.
