### In a Nutshell
Method Development in liquid chromatography (LC) often involves intensive labour due to the high complexity and diversity that can be encountered in samples. Smart solutions such as retention modelling (RM) can aid analytical chemists to minimise the method-development time. With RM, retention times of compounds are modelled as a function of mobile-phase compositions (e.g., based on multiple isocratic or gradient runs), allowing for the prediction of analyte retention times at different compositions. Using RM, entire separations can be predicted for given gradient profiles. While such strategies may lower the method-development time, research on their implementation in a fully automated framework is lacking.
